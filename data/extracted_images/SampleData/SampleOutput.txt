/home/philip/anaconda3/envs/busedge/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/_tensor.py:575: UserWarning: floor_divide is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of pytorch. It currently rounds toward 0 (like the 'trunc' function NOT 'floor'). This results in incorrect rounding for negative values.
To keep the current behavior, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='trunc'), or for actual floor division, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='floor'). (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1623448265233/work/aten/src/ATen/native/BinaryOps.cpp:467.)
